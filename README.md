# Linear Model Fitting â€“ LSQFit (Week 2)
This project implements a simple linear regression (least squares fitting) model in Python as part of Week 2: LSQFit Exercise for the course DATA.ML.100 â€“ Introduction to Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning at TAU Computing Sciences.

ðŸ“Œ Task Overview
Derive the least squares solution for the linear model:
y = ax + b
using N > 2 training samples.

Implement the solution in a function:
my_linfit(x, y) â†’ returns slope a and intercept b.

Collect training points via mouse input (left-click to add, right-click to finish).
